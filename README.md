Here we record some result metrics and TO-DOs. Let's go!

## RESULTS

---
We are currently using Sergey's updated Deepnose embeddings trained on the Leffingwell dataset (task is 3000 mono molecules for descriptor scoring, descriptor represented with Word2Vec?).

We use RF and RGBoost models to see if Deepnose features is predictable for perceptual distance.

## TO-DO:

- rewind the data papers and summarize them (this week);
- why we see Snitz 1 spread differently?
- create dimension wise difference features

## IDEAS (good or bad)

1. Make use of multiple bigger dataset:
	1. Combine Deepnose trained on different descriptor sets, using alignment like "cross model fine-tuning aligned and refined"
		- but not sure if Deepnose does well on all of them
	
	2. Fine tune the descriptors with domain specific texts
		- might be really more involved than we thought
	
2. Improve Deepnose's design: I heard recently there are some ways to do 3D invariance learning for molecules (not GNNs)

3. Make use of other datasets (same mixture scores and non equal intensity mixtures (concentraion?)): need to read the papers first

4. Combine with Dragon features 


Just for the sake of discussion:

1. Diffusion models for molecule to learn the spatial distribution??? As there are so many odor molecules

2. Alphafold 3 ??
