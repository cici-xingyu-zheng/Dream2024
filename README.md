### TO-DO:

- rewind the data papers and summarize them (this week);
- why we see Snitz 1 spread differently?

### IDEAS (good or bad)

1. Make use of multiple bigger dataset:
	1. Combine Deepnose trained on different descriptor sets, using alignment like "cross model fine-tuning aligned and refined"
		- but not sure if Deepnose does well on all of them
	
	2. Fine tune the descriptors with domain specific texts
		- might be really more involved than we thought
	
3. Improve Deepnose's design: I heard recently there are some ways to do 3D invariance learning for molecules (not GNNs)

Just for the sake of discussion:

4. Diffusion models for molecule to learn the spatial distribution??? As there are so many odor molecules

5. Alphafold 3 ??
